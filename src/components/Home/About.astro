  <h2>About Me</h2>
 <p>I'm Athul Subash Marottikkal, a Computer Science graduate (2025) from Trent University, Canada, with a strong foundation in web development and a growing passion for system-level programming. I’ve worked extensively with React, Astro, Three.js, HTML, and CSS, and I enjoy building fast,clean, and reliable software that works seamlessly across platforms.</p>
<p>During my time at <a href="https://easyfits.ca">EasyFits</a> as a Software Developer, I contributed to several major engineering initiatives. I refactored and re-architected the company’s React website, resulting in a cleaner, more maintainable codebase and significantly improved performance. I also led the team behind <strong>Project Elevate</strong>, a virtual try-on system that automated more than 120 unique 3D outfit combinations. This involved building scalable Python-driven tooling, running cloth physics simulations, and developing scripts to optimize internal workflows. Over time, I also supervised other interns and helped maintain development standards across the team.</p>
<p>Although most of my professional experience is in web development, I’m actively exploring opportunities in software engineering, systems programming, and game development. I’ve been coding since I was 13,daily-drive Arch Linux, and enjoy solving problems across different layers of the stack. In my spare time, I work on a Unity space shooter game and contribute to open-source projects.</p>
<p>Outside of programming, I’m interested in math, cooking, and astronomy—fields that influence how I think about problems and design solutions.</p>
